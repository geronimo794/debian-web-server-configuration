# Monitoring
- ## Promotheus(Docker)
To run promotheus via Docker is quiet simple.
1. First, download your promotheus.yml configuration on https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/documentation/examples/prometheus.yml
2. Place it promotheus folder
3. Run your promotheus docker
```
docker run \
    -p 9090:9090 \
    -v /path/to/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
    prom/prometheus
```
4. Your, promotheus now can be accessed on localhost:9090

- ## Promotheus Node Exporter
Promotheus Node Exporter use for gather our machine information. So, we need to install it on our local machine. Instead on the docker.
1. Find out your server architecture and os information
```
lscpu
```
2. Find the correct version of node_exporter for your Debian server on https://prometheus.io/download/#node_exporter
3. Download and install it
```
wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v*/node_exporter-*.*-amd64.tar.gz
tar xvfz node_exporter-*.*-amd64.tar.gz
cd node_exporter-*.*-amd64
./node_exporter
```
4. From now, node_exporter will expose your server metrics on http://localhost:9100/metrics
5. Set up your promotheus to read the metrics. Add this line on promotheus.yml
```
scrape_configs:
...
- job_name: main-server
  static_configs:
  - targets: ['localhost:9100']
```
6. Restart your Promotheus engin that run on docker

- ## Grafana(Docker)
